    <h1>🚀 Shortest-Distance-Finder - Java Implementation</h1>

  <p>Welcome to my project, where I've taken the world of algorithms and Java to create the "Shortest-Distance-Finder." 🌐</p>

  <h2>Project Overview</h2>

  <p>The "Shortest-Distance-Finder" is all about efficient pathfinding using Dijkstra's algorithm. Here's what you can expect:</p>

  <ul>
        <li>✨ <strong>Dijkstra's Algorithm:</strong> I've implemented this legendary algorithm to find the shortest path in a graph or dataset. 🛤️</li>
        <li>🚄 <strong>Optimization:</strong> I've obsessed over performance, making sure path calculations are as fast as lightning! ⚡</li>
        <li>🎥 <strong>Interactive Visualization:</strong> You won't just see results, but an interactive, step-by-step visualization of the pathfinding process. 📊</li>
        <li>🧠 <strong>Educational Value:</strong> Besides creating a powerful tool, this project was a fantastic learning journey. I deepened my understanding of algorithmic principles and data structures. 📚</li>
    </ul>
